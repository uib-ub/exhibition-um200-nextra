# Creating content with Github Codespaces
 
This a guide for how to create content for the exhibition website on Githubs Codespaces. See the [UI components](#ui-components) section for a list of components that can be used to create content.

## Accessing the Codespaces

To access the Codespaces, you need to have a Github account and be a member of the [uib-ub](https://github.com/orgs/uib-ub) organization.

Once you have access, you can use the powerful, online code editor to create and edit content for the exhibition website.

## Creating content

Before starting to create content, you need to create a new branch. This branch will "collect" your changes until you are ready to commit and push your changes to the main branch. 

The branch can be used only by you or you can share it with other users.

<Steps>
### Creating a new branch

### Naming the branch

You can name the branch whatever you want. But it is a good idea to name it something that describes the changes you are making.
