# Creating content with Github Codespaces
 
This a guide for how to create content for the exhibition website on Githubs Codespaces. See the [UI components](#ui-components) section for a list of components that can be used to create content.

## Accessing the Codespaces

To access the Codespaces, you need to have a Github account and be a member of the [uib-ub](https://github.com/orgs/uib-ub) organization.

Once you have access, you can use the powerful, online code editor to create and edit content for the exhibition website.


<Steps>
### Click "Code" button"

### Creating or restarting a Codespace

### Your Codespace is ready

</Steps>

## Creating content

Before starting to create content, you need to create a new branch. This branch will "collect" your changes until you are ready to commit and push your changes to the main branch. 

The branch can be used only by you or you can share it with other users.

<Steps>
### Creating a new branch

</figure>

### Naming the branch

You can name the branch whatever you want. But it is a good idea to name it something that describes the changes you are making.

### Start creating your content

</figure>
</Steps>


## Folder structure and page paths

The content is stored in the "content" folder. The folder structure is as follows. `_meta.ts` is a file that controls the side menu and the page title. The folder name and file name creates the page path, e.g. `/tema/arkeologi/oseberg`.

<FileTree>
  <FileTree.Folder name="content" defaultOpen>
    <FileTree.File name="_meta.ts" />
    <FileTree.File name="om.mdx" />
    <FileTree.File name="index.mdx" />
    <FileTree.Folder name="tema" defaultOpen>
      <FileTree.File name="_meta.ts" />
      <FileTree.File name="index.mdx" />
      <FileTree.Folder name="arkeologi" defaultOpen>
        <FileTree.File name="_meta.ts" />
        <FileTree.File name="index.mdx" />
        <FileTree.File name="oseberg.mdx" />
      </FileTree.Folder>
    </FileTree.Folder>
  </FileTree.Folder>
</FileTree>

## Committing and pushing your changes

<Steps>
### Making changes to your content

<div className="flex flex-row gap-4">
  <figure>
    <Image className="my-5" src={gh_make_changes_1} alt="Screenshot of the make changes to your content" />
    <figcaption>Make changes to your content</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <figure>
    <Image className="my-5" src={gh_make_changes_2} alt="Screenshot of the commit and push your changes" />
    <figcaption>Git (Version Control) is used to track changes to your content. Note that line 39 is colored an indicates that this line has been changed.</figcaption>
  </figure>
</div>

### Switch to the Source Control tab and delete the package-lock.json file

First switch to the _Source Control_ tab (`1`). If you see the file `package-lock.json`, delete it by clicking the _discard_ (`2`) button and confirm by clicking the _Discard File_ (`3`) button. Now you should be left with one or more files that you have changed.

<figure>
  <Image className="my-5" src={gh_delete_package_lock} alt="Screenshot of the commit and push your changes" />
  <figcaption>The package-lock.json file is not needed and can be deleted. It is automatically generated by npm and can cause conflicts when pushing changes.</figcaption>
</figure>

### Commit your changes

Click on the file to see the changes you have made. If all is well, click the "+" button by the files you want to commit.

<figure>
  <Image className="my-5" src={gh_add_to_staged} alt="Screenshot of the commit and push your changes" />
  <figcaption>Click the "+" button by the files you want to commit. In this example, we have added the file `content/tema/arkeologi/index.mdx`.</figcaption>
</figure>

You can add multiple files to the "Staged changes" list by clicking the "+" button by the files you want to commit. This prepares the changes for the commit. Add a commit message in the input field shown below. Click the "Commit" button to commit your changes.

<figure>
  <Image className="my-5" src={gh_add_commit_message} alt="Screenshot of the commit and push your changes" />
  <figcaption>Add a commit message and click the "Commit" button.</figcaption>
</figure>

### Push your changes

Click the "Push" button to push your branch to the remote repository.

<figure>
  <Image className="my-5" src={gh_publish_branch} alt="Screenshot of the commit and push your changes" />
  <figcaption>Click the "Push" button to push your changes to the remote repository.</figcaption>

### Create a pull request

Click the "Create a pull request" button to create a pull request to the main branch. Do this reight away after _publishing_ your branch, as the dialog dissapears after a few seconds.

Creating a pull request (PR) is the way we trigger a preview of the website on Vercel (our plattform for hosting the website).
